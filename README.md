# The PinkCrab FunctionConstructors library.

This package forms a part of the PinkCrab plugin and theme framework but can be used independantly. This package is usually installed as submodule and as result doesnt have any composer ready functionality.

Tests are run from the main framework body using a custom suite in phpUnit. If you wish to test these independantly, you should be able to do so. We use a prefix of test- on all test cases.

For more detials on using the package, please vistit the repos wiki.
