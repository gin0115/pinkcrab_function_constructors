    <summary> Can be used to create a Closure</summary>
    <div class="details__content">
        <p>
            This function returns a Closure, which can be used just like a regular function, without the need to pollute the global namespace.
        </p>
        <p>
            The produced Closure can be reused throughout your code and can even be passed as a variable to other functions or as a callable for a higher order function like `array_map()`.
