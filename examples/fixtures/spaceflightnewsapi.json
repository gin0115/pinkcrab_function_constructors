The hurricane plowed through NASA facilities in the area on the evening of October 28, causing roof and siding damage at the Michoud Assembly Facility (MAF) in New Orleans East and knocking out power across a wide part of the metro region.\n\nBoeing is the prime contractor for the SLS Core Stage and is conducting the Green Run test campaign at the Stennis Space Center in nearby Southern Mississippi; NASA believes they have identified the cause of an intermittent fault with a liquid hydrogen (LH2) prevalve and are preparing to perform repairs. Stennis was also hit by Zeta, but saw less intense conditions than MAF as the storm weakened racing inland and the space agency is still hoping to complete the final Green Run tests by the end of the year.",
